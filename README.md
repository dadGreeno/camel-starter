# camel-starter
This a simple intro project to get Spring Boot running and have camel configured. 

## basic file watch/move route
This route watches for file drop in a given directory and based on file name moves them to the correct folder, edits when necessary or logs an error message.

All files get processed and moved into a `.camel` folder once completed.
